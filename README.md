## Giphy-AJAX-HW
This project was made to practice skills referencing an API, and practicing with AJAX.

## Motivation
Individual API's can be challenging to use, and giphy is one that is used more and more commonly throughout the web. I chose to use gifs of comedians specifically because following stand-up comedy is a large pasttime of mine.

## Technologies used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, & AJAX



## Features
Clicking on one of the buttons displays 10 gifs of the search term, in this case various comedians, and that gif's rating. Typing a name into the search bar and hitting submit or the enter button adds that term to the button list. Clicking that new button displays gifs related to that term.
